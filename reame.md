I think one should at least learn basic data structures and some algorithms in depth so as to get into Competitive Programming. Competitive Programming isn’t like doing any course or you will learn that. It’s like a sport where you will have to work hard, practice a lot of questions, giving contests and much more.

Let me tell you about few points which I think everyone should follow before diving much into Competitive Programming.

Pick any Language: - First, learn any language i.e. either C++ or Java and that will be best for you. Learn either C++ or Java and Never go for Python as your first language as it contains a lot of inbuilt features through which you will not be able to understand some features as the first language.
Learn Data Structures and Algorithms: - This is the most important part in one’s journey i.e. Learning Data Structures and Algorithms. One should always learn in very depth and should always clear their doubts as these are very important. So Always clear each and every doubt before moving to the next topic. Learn these basic Data Structures first: -
Arrays, Strings
Linked Lists, Stacks, and Queues
Trees like Generic Trees,
Recursion and Backtracking
Basics of DP
Bit Manipulation and some other topics too.

Then after learning that, solve a minimum of 20–25+ Questions in every topic so that you can learn each and everything in depth.
Then start giving contests like Codechef Long challenge, Codeforces Div 3, Atcoder basic contests, and in these contests never care about rankings. Sometimes, You will be able to solve a good number of questions and sometimes not even one.
Then focus on Advance Data Structures like: -
Advance Algorithms of DP, DP on Trees
Segment Trees, Fenwick Trees
Advance Graph Algos
Number Theory And some other topics too.
Also, Practice a lot of questions of these topics and learn new algorithms from cpalgorithms.
Now you will be even able to solve hard Questions of Codeforces Div 2 and some other contests too.
Also follow some of the great resources: -
Codechef DSA Learning Series: - This is also a very good resource for learning DSA but It is not for complete beginners as It has some hard Questions too which can make one easily demotivated.
Codeforces A2OJ Ladders: - These ladders are the best ladders and I think one should always solve that before stepping into the Codeforces contests. The questions here are really very good.
Some Good Youtube channels and courses: -
Youtube channels: - There are some very good channels that have posted very good content like Pepcoding, Striver channel, Code N Code, and some others too.
Paid Courses: - There are some paid courses available too and I have even done one of them. I have learned Data Structures and Algorithms Course from Coding Ninjas. The course was really very good and really helped me a lot in understanding the concepts in depth and The Best Part was Doubt Support from TAs. The TAs were very helpful and explained each and everything in depth.
